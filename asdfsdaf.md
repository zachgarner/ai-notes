Open Source


The main large open source foundation models to pay attention to are: Llama, **Qwen**, Deep Seek, GPT-OSS

- Qwen & DeepSeek score well on current livebench (~70), while Llama 4 and GPT-OSS fall far behind (47)
- GPT-OSS is OpenAI’s open source model based on GPT. The performance is good - but I suspect the company doesn’t stand behind it’s open source contributions and would adopt with some hesitation

Proprietary

- OpenAI’s GPT models - top tier, leader of the industry.
- Anthropic’s Claude models - just below OpenAI’s GPT, but far more expensive
- Third teir is:
    - X’s Grok - scoring 72.11 on livebench, followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro Max Thinking (70.95) and the open source Qwen 3 235B Thinking (70.76), DeepSeek v3.1 Thinking (70.75)
- Llama 4 has failed to keep up. LiveB ench score of 47.78

| Model                    | LiveBench (General) | Price                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Claude Opus 4.1 Thinking | 73.48               | Input: $15/million
Output: $75/million |
| GPT 5 High               | 78.59               | Input: $1.25/mil
Output: $10/mil       |

- So at surface level GPT-5 is 10x cheaper yet top tier performance vs Anthropic. However, GPT 5 High uses significantly more tokens, so the actual cost difference will require analysis

Benchmarks

- LiveBench is the most reliable benchmark board. [https://livebench.ai/#/](https://livebench.ai/#/)
